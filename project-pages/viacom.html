						<h4 class="projectcopy"> Challenge </h4>

							<div>In my time at ViacomCBS, I worked primarily on a product called Viacom Bridge. Bridge was internal order-management software used by brands and production teams to streamline content production and facilitate the order process. When I joined the team in <br><br>


							The challenge was TBA TBA TBA
							</div>

						<h4 class="projectcopy"> Process & Solution </h4>

							<div> TBA<br><br>

							TBA<br><br>
							1. The app needs to be easily accessible to the sales team, who only have the client's attention for a limited time.<br><br>
							2. The app needs to function as an active database and track accounts which owe balances or have paid in full. <br><br>
							3. The app needs to provide a convenient and straightforward way to pay balances.<br><br>
							4. The app needs to accomodate account/business owners, who may not be technologically savvy. <br><br>
							5. The app needs to minimize clicks to expedite the ordering process.<br><br>
							6. The app should have provide transparent pricing structures for products.<br><br>
							7. The app should support the account-salesperson relationship, wherever possible. <br><br>
							8. The app should have security features to prevent individuals and non-business owners from placing orders.<br><br>


							For the first iteration, our MVP was the development and release of the app for Sales to place orders. Our second iteration was the release of a consumer-facing website, and the third iteration (underway) is to activate an e-commerce portal where businesses could place orders independently of a salesperson. We used this timeline in accordance with end-of-year goals, press releases, and legal considerations. <br></div>

						<h4 class="projectcopy"> My Role</h4>

							<div> I lead the user experience, interfacing, and design components of this project. I incorporated user wants, needs and feedback into a backlog and prioritized tasks based on importance to our MVP. My goal was to make sense of the data from each team and structure it in a way that balanced both user and business needs.<br></div>
