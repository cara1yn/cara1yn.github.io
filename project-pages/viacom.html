	      				<h4>Overview</h4>

	      				New feature development and ongoing UI/UX improvements in Viacom's order-management software.<br>

	      				<h4>Challenges</h4>

	      				Viacom Bridge is an internal order-management product used by brands and production teams to streamline content production and facilitate the order process. Users in Bridge can place, track, and fulfill orders, which are broken into itemized tasks and assigned to specific teams/users.<br><br>

						As part of a team of other UX/UI designers, the challenges were to streamline the product with the goal of making it more accessible and user-friendly to all of our user base. I worked closely with product owners, BAs, UX researchers & designers, developers, users and stakeholders. Based on the epics planned each quarter, our work was evenly split between iterative usability updates and new features. <br><br>

						Each assignment required thorough research, planning, and design. Some specific challenges I was assigned to or heavily-involved in were:<br><br>
							1. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1icV2hos4RVupNrN3S7ItqN4-_bjAgbEsXxcqttNqZGg/edit#slide=id.g3fc1d7e877_0_34"><span class="cyan accent-1">the Video Order workflow</span></a><br><br>
							2. a new Press Order workflow<br><br>
							3. the Bulk Submission feature<br><br>
							4. an <a href="https://invis.io/GKX4CW3PFQR"><span class="cyan accent-1">Order Landing Page</span></a><br><br>
							5. the Dashboard hub<br><br>

						<h4>My Role</h4>

						I worked most closely with product and design to determine which items on the roadmap needed the most attention and which were attainable per sprint and quarterly. Collaboratively with product, I conducted user interviews and A/B testing on new designs we were trialing. Weekly assignments might be a mix of wireframing a new workflow, refactoring an existing page, or conducting user interviews while planning a new feature.
